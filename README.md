Udacity CS 253 Blog WebApp on Google App Engine.

Running version can be found here: http://first-blog-smp.appspot.com/blog

Very little done in terms of HTML

most submissions are from the grading scripts.

Also, hostip.info seems to not be functioning properly when delivering the 
coordinates, hence many faulty submissions to Google Maps which do not reflect the actual users' location.

Google Datastore and memcache used for users and blog entries.

Futher implementations:

1. HTML, customization
2. Admin user
3. Resolve location service bugs - find alternate provider for ip address?

Had a lot of fun writing this - first actual program/ web app I've ever written that can dom something 
actually helpful (if you dont't count the cash register programs... :) )
